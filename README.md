# UNET-CBAM_Vineyard
Viticulture is the science and art of grapes cultivation. In the bustling world of viticulture,
precision is paramount. VineNet: Grasp of the Grapes is an exciting hackathon
challenge tailored to revolutionize vineyard management through cutting-edge deep
learning techniques. The task at hand? Crafting a lightweight fast deep learning model to
precisely segment grape bunches in high-resolution vineyard images.

in this the file started with Unet implementation and on that used self attention in layers just above the bottleneck with CBAM method that is a convolution.
Then used YOLO v8 pretrained weights, :
first prepared the dataset in accordance with the yolov8 model requiremnts.
